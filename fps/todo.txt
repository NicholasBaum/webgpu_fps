normal mapping
turn off mipmaps for normal MipMaps?
check if normal maps have to be loaded as linear space
check if [0, 0, 1, 1] is the correct color for a do nothing normal map

    Blinn-Phong Shader
    Implemented Texturing with MipMaps
    Instance Rendering

Misc
    move material from assett to instance,
        textures can't be placed in structs and an array of textures isn't allowed either, i think
        so you ll have to run multiple passes to render the same asset with different textures
        obviously you only have to rebind different combinations of vertex data and materials
        the none texture related material data coul be moved into the instance struct
