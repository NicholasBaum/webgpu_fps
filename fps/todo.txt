move texture to gpu material struct 
only use textures and remove solid diffusevalues
deploy on gitpages
multiple lights
ui
shadows
move material from assett to instance,
    renderer needs to write an array of materials to the gpu
    probably set an material id in the Model struct and use it to look up the correct material
