use filter in shadowmap


light_mat can be stored in Light class initially and perhaps keep it there with an index corresponding to a texture slot
v1 of shadowmap optionality will have to use an array of light_mats and a low fixed count of shadowmaps because i havent testet texture array oder megatextures yet

more sophisticated lightview creation in ShadowMapRenderer
    check how do calc go view range    


light transforms update lead to recalc of shadowmap
models transform updates could lead to recalc of lightmaps as there might be better positions
do some none linear scaling in TextureRendering
moving lights
multiple lights/multiple shadows 

environtment mapping is important for good metallic renders, check how metallic reflections actually work and if this can be Implemented before PBR
pbr render
load 3d models
resizable canvas
3d scan fancy tea saucers and render

deffered rendering
raytraced shadows
implement screenspace reflection
implement screenspace gi
implement cryengine lightning

Done
    UV Tiling
    Normal Mapping
    Ui
    Multiple Lights
    Blinn-Phong Shader
    Implemented Texturing with MipMaps
    Instance Rendering
    Box and Pipe Geometry with Normals
    
    
    
Remark
    -   merging shaders by string concatenation, could be fixed by some more sophisticated string substitution module (preprocessor)
        with some error message interception to fix the wrong line numbers (see https://jsgist.org/?src=cb4acc6a854a7176e88af7e6a145130d)
        only the last group of a shader can be left unset what isn't really helpful
    -   normal map rendering and ambient don't work to well together as when you have no light only the ambient is rendered
        but no normal map effect is visible this happens in shadow map cases and when surface isn't facing a light
        
    -   if you load a texture as e.g. srgb the sampler converts it to linear space automatically
        krita tells me my textures are in srgb space but loading them as srgb didn't have any visible changes


Backlog
    -   Shadows from NormalMap
    -   Shadow Voulumes
    -   Raytraced Shadows
    -   renderer/pipeline builder could compose BindGroup instead of GPUBuffers, meaning types lile Material hold BindGroups instead of buffer,
        but can't see much of an advantage at the moment

    -   move material from assett to instance,
        textures can't be placed in structs and an array of textures isn't allowed either, i think
        so you ll have to run multiple passes to render the same asset with different textures
        obviously you only have to rebind different combinations of vertex data and materials
        the none texture related material data coul be moved into the instance struct
    
    -   create smoothed tangent vectors like in the rust webgpu normalmap example

    -   parralax mapping
