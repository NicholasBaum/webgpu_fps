Misc
    move material from assett to instance,
        textures can't be placed in structs and an array of textures isn't allowed either, i think
        so you ll have to run multiple passes to render the same asset with different textures
        obviously you only have to rebind different combinations of vertex data and materials
        the none texture related material data coul be moved into the instance struct
