normal mapping
consider removing disableNormalMap in light or fix the not working ui 
check smoothing in normal map
check reorthogonalization
optimize the fragmentshader loop perhaps remove the funciton
turn off mipmaps for normal MipMaps?
check if normal maps have to be loaded as linear space
check if normal maps use a different sampler
check if [0, 0, 1, 1] is the correct color for a do nothing normal map
uv tiling
render downloaded texture examples
shadows
load 3d models
pbr render
3d scan fancy tea saucers and render
implement lumen lightning
raytraced shadows

Done
    Ui
    Multiple Lights
    Blinn-Phong Shader
    Implemented Texturing with MipMaps
    Instance Rendering
    Box and Pipe Geometry with Normals
    
    
    



Backlog
    move material from assett to instance,
    textures can't be placed in structs and an array of textures isn't allowed either, i think
    so you ll have to run multiple passes to render the same asset with different textures
    obviously you only have to rebind different combinations of vertex data and materials
    the none texture related material data coul be moved into the instance struct
