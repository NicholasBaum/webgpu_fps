Done
    Box and pipe geometry with normals
    Blinn-Phong Shader
    Multiple Lights





Misc
    move material from assett to instance,
        textures can't be placed in structs and an array of textures isn't allowed either, i think
        so the only optimisation would be not to rewrite the geometry for very instance but only the material
